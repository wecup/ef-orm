 * values, and it provides methods for getting and setting the value of a

 * change was a delete, insert, or update.

 * Note that column numbers for rowsets start at <code>1</code>, whereas the

 * method <code>getColumnUpdated</code> refers to the column number in the
 * rowset (the first column is <code>1</code>); the argument for
 * <code>setColumnUpdated</code> refers to the index into the rowset's internal
 * bitset (the first bit is <code>0</code>).
